## :wrench: Developer Instructions

### Prerequisites

:warning: These packages needs to be installed

:heavy_plus_sign: Docker\
:heavy_plus_sign: Docker Compose\
:heavy_plus_sign: Visual Studio Code

### :computer: Open the repo with Visual Studio Code

Upon opening, you should be prompted to open the project in a **remote container**. This will build a container on top of the base uavcast-community container with all the development dependencies installed. This ensures everyone uses a consistent development environment without the need to install any dependencies on your host machine.

If vscode does not start the remote container automatically, use hotkeys: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> and select <kbd>Remote-Container: Rebuild and Reopen container</kbd>

After starting the container for the first time, it will install some additional package, give it few minutes to complete.

<br />

### Run uavcast-community from the command line

VSCode will start the docker compose file for you and open a terminal window connected to `/app/uavcast` folder.

:heavy_minus_sign: Run `cd backend && npm install`\
:heavy_minus_sign: Run `cd frontend && npm install`\
:heavy_minus_sign: Run `npm start` from the project root to start both frontend & backend.

### Supervisor

Uavcast-community uses a supervisor container to manage the application update ect. Supervisor is not needed for development.
To run the supervisor, type `cd supervisor && npm install && npm start` from the uavcast-community project root.

### Teardown

After closing VSCode, you may still have containers running. To close everything down, just run\
`docker-compose down -v` to cleanup all containers.

### Making changes

Do not make large sweeping changes. Open a discussion on GitHub for any large or architectural ideas.
Ensure lint passes. `npm run lint` This command will ensure basic conformance to styles, applying as many automatic fixes as possible, including Prettier formatting.

### Build docker locally

Use these commands in the project root (!not in the vscode developer container).\
Type `./compile_release.sh` + arguments to genereate local docker image, or you can publish to your own container registery.

Example local build:\
`./compile_release.sh --image_name sinamics/uavcast --version 5.x.x --docker_local`

run docker image locally:

```docker
docker run --restart unless-stopped --name uavcast -d \
    -v uavdata:/app/uavcast/data \
    -v /var/lib/zerotier-one:/var/lib/zerotier-one \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /dev:/dev \
    --privileged=true --net=host [image_name]:[version]
```
